    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
    intelligent machines. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the 
    development of algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with 
    multiple layers. It has been particularly successful in image recognition, 
    natural language processing, and speech recognition.
    
    Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are examples of deep learning models 
    that can understand and generate human-like text.
